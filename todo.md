- [] Add metadata information like description, author, license, mainProgram
- [] Embed option that allows defining which exact nushell version is used
  - [] Take a look at https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/blob/master/modules/programs/helix.nix
- [] Potentially add overlay to make it easier to find the package but only if remains possible to define which nushell version to use
- [] Further investigate if it possible to write a Hyprland window switcher simulation test
